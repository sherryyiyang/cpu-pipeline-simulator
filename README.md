## cpu-pipeline-simulator
A simple simulation of a pipelined CPU architecture implemented in Go/Python/C++. This project models a classic 5-stage pipeline (Fetch, Decode, Execute, Memory, Writeback), including hazard detection, forwarding, and basic branch prediction. Designed to help visualize and understand low-level CPU behavior and instruction flow.
